- If the player rolls a 1 on any of the dice, all his/hers round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- If the player rolls a 6 twice in a row on the same die, all his/hers total score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn

- The players can decide to set different than default (100) amount of points for winning before starting the game. The points are set by typing into the "winning score" window before starting the new game
